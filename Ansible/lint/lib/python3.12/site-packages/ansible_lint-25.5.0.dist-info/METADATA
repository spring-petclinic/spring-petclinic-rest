# Ansible-lint

`ansible-lint` checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could
potentially be improved. As a community-backed project ansible-lint supports
only the last two major versions of Ansible.

[Visit the Ansible Lint docs site](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/)

# Using ansible-lint as a GitHub Action

This action allows you to run `ansible-lint` on your codebase without having to
install it yourself.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml
name: ansible-lint
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "stable", "release/v*"]
jobs:
  build:
    name: Ansible Lint # Naming the build is important to use it as a status check
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run ansible-lint
        uses: ansible/ansible-lint@main
        # optional (see below):
        with:
          args: ""
          setup_python: "true"
          working_directory: ""
          requirements_file: ""
```

All the arguments are optional and most users should not need them:

- `args`: Arguments to be passed to ansible-lint command.
- `setup_python`: If python should be installed. Default is `true`.
- `working_directory`: The directory where to run ansible-lint from. Default is
  `github.workspace`. That might be needed if you want to lint only a subset of
  your repository.
- `requirements_file`: Path to the requirements.yml file to install role and
  collection dependencies.

For more details, see [ansible-lint-action].
